# Multithreaded Algorithms (Go)

## Purpose
Tinkering with Go. This module is not meant to be a production-grade solution. It is meant to be a proof-of-concept of the skills in the Go programming language.

I am new to Go, and as such I intend to experiment with goroutines to gain a better understanding of Go. Goroutines are a key feature of Go (even Go's compiler takes advantage of multithreading, hence the fast compile times), and as such multi-threaded algorithms seemed to be the
