# Multithreaded Algorithms (Go)
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tests-Passing?-green)

## Purpose
Tinkering with Go. This module is not meant to be a production-grade solution. It is meant to be a proof-of-concept of the skills in the Go programming language.

I am new to Go, and as such I intend to experiment with goroutines to gain a better understanding of Go. Goroutines are a key feature of Go (even Go's compiler takes advantage of multithreading, hence the fast compile times), and as such multi-threaded algorithms seemed to be the

## Implemented Structures and Algorithms
 I've currently implemented unit tests for completed algorithms. The unit tests are passing, and you can run them by running ```go test``` in the target package directory. However, go test has different results than individually running these tests. This will be looked into for the following commits.
